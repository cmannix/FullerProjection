# Fuller Projection

Small library to project latitude and longitude pairs to points on Fullers Dymaxion projection.

Something of a work in progress - the transformation may not be entirely accurate at this point.

Also badly needs some tests.

Based almost entirely on the work of RW Gray, with some adaptions to make it (subjectively) a little easier to use:
